# Full Stack Project
This is a project that I created during my internship at OBSS. It contains a java back-end and react front-end and mysql database is used to store the data.

# About the Project
This project contains 3 user types: ADMIN, USER, SELLER.

USER --> Can add products to his/her favoritelist or add a seller into blacklist.
SELLER --> Can create, update or delete his own product.
ADMIN --> Can delete user, seller, product and update their information.

# Requirements
IntelliJ Idea Ultimate Edition Ide and VSCode are used to implement the project. The data is managed using the MYSQL database. The Java Spring Framework is utilized on the backend.
Sprig Security and Json-Web-Token are used to ensure the safety of users.
